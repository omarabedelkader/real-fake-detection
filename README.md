# Neural Network Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains a neural network classifier implemented in Python, leveraging TensorFlow/Keras to demonstrate the process of model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results. The project is fully documented in a Jupyter Notebook, guiding you step-by-step through data preprocessing, model construction, and performance analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading datasets, handling missing values, and preparing data for model training.
- **Model Construction**: Building a customizable neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Training and Tuning**: Training the model on processed data with tunable hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation & Visualization**: Evaluating model performance and visualizing training results and metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data handling and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations of data and model metrics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and result presentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python >= 3.6**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab** for interactive execution
- **Packages**: TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-classification.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
    ```bash
    cd neural-network-classification
    ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. **Run the Notebook**: Open `NN-Classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the project results.

## Results

The project will produce:
- **Training Metrics**: Accuracy and loss plots over epochs.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representations of the model's performance and data insights.
